Learning Unity 2D Game: Dungeon Escape
Source Course From Udemy


## Overview

The course begins with an introduction to TileMap, which gives developers the ability to 
paint different worlds! Students will then begin setting up the player for combat and developing attack 
systems found within popular hack & slash type games. Students will also develop a shop system that grants players 
the ability to purchase items.  If the player canâ€™t afford an item, they can choose to watch a Unity Ad 
in exchange for 100 gems!  This way, players are rewarded for watching ads, helping make the game profitable.  
Throughout this course, students will explore intermediate to advanced topics in C#, 
including class inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces, 
which help build modular systems within games and applications.
